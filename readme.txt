== Description ==
ZS Social Chat will help you to add WhatsApp Chat Button in your website so that your users can connect with you through WhatsApp & WhatsApp Business. You can say the button as a Standalone WhatsApp Button. Because we only support WhatsApp button so that you can achieve just one thing with one plugin. You have to just add your Phone Number and the Position you want to set for Button. Plus a message visitor can ask you for first time chat.
